# Deee_PKI
**Distributed Public Key Infrastructure which runs on HoloChain**


## About dpki:
To understand this application better. We are doing this in two parts.
* Key Management
* Identity Services

### Key Management
**Entries:**
* Agents/Users (perm_dpki_id, initial_public_key, shared_ID
  * This is the initial user that is created.
  * At this stage their is no revocation method that is declared. So we would have a default can be revoked by adding a new Key Entry which if it specifies a revocation method, must be revoked .

* Key Registration Entries (perm_agent_id, pub_key, shared_id, **revocation_Method_ID**)
 * This is used when the user decides which revocation method he uses.  

### Identity Services
**Note:** Design in progress

**Entries:**
* Identity Servers (network_type, address (IP or domain), port)

## Work Done
* Created the User.
* Assigned the Key Registration for the User (For not the revocation method is set to 1 (i.e Revocation Key Method)).
* Created the UI for the first Self revocation


## In Progress:
Focuses on the first part i.e. the **Key Management**
* Starting work on the M of N revocation Method()
